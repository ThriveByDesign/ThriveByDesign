<p> My name is Anonsa and as a User experience designer || engineer. I plan to join the league of creators. Instead of just thoughts and doodles, I want my ideas and designs to become an integral part of creating solutions. </p>

This is the beginning. This is my design. To watch my creative journey unfold: Follow me on insta! @thrive.bydesign
